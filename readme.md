Bidijkstra (Bi-directional Dijkstra Algorithm)
---

This package is a rewrite of the algorithmic component of an art project I did in Sept 2017 for the DeptfordX festival in London. 

Originally it was really OO style which is no longer cool, so I aim to make it more

* elegant
* immutable
* functional

In addition, I wanted it to

* have reusable components (where possible)
* work with an almost schema-less data i.e. most simplified expression of a graph data structure
* have a pure search function allowing extensibilty of node structure (not fully there yet)
* demonstrate the relationship & difference between searches
* make use of es6+
* be fun to write (e.g. no trailing commas)

TODO
---
* more functional
* browser compatable
* chainable heuristic patterns
* fix the tests!
